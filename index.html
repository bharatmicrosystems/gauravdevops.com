Kubernetes changes the traditional concept of running a separate virtual machine for every application and instead allows you to forget about the underlying infrastructure and just deploy pods in a cluster of generic nodes. That not only simplifies the architecture but also makes managing infrastructure easy.</p><p>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform, and the code base is available online on GitHub. While this enables contribution from the community, it also provides hackers with an opportunity to find loopholes and prepare for an attack. Most automation tools that set up Kubernetes cater to a variety of users, and therefore they do not enforce all security by default. ...</p></div>      <a class="more-link" href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-secure-kubernetes-using-network-policies-bbb940909364?source=friends_link&sk=1b817da088a6785fe6390edc349a24d4" target="_blank">Read more &rarr;</a>    </div><!--//media-body-->  </div><!--//media--></div><!--//item--><div class="item mb-5">  <div class="media">      <div class="media-body">      <h3 class="title mb-1"><a href="blog.html?slug=%40bharatmicrosystems%2Fservice-discovery-of-non-kubernetes-workloads-from-kubernetes-and-vice-versa-84a575ec4d8%3Fsource%3Dfriends_link%26sk%3Dde18ab5c72d4302c1634884230040213" target="_blank">How to Discover non-Kubernetes applications using Kubernetes Service Discovery</a></h3> <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published Apr-21</span><span class="time">7 min read</span></div>           <div class="intro"><p>How to use Ingress Resources to discover Non-Kubernetes services using NGINX and BIND DNS</p><p><img class="mr-3 img-fluid d-none d-md-flex" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*3O7PwBTVgabeCEXu" alt="image"></p><p>Kubernetes provides an excellent inbuilt service discovery through kubernetes services and employs the CoreDNS to resolve services internally within the Kubernetes cluster. ...</p></div>      <a class="more-link" href="https://medium.com/@bharatmicrosystems/service-discovery-of-non-kubernetes-workloads-from-kubernetes-and-vice-versa-84a575ec4d8?source=friends_link&sk=de18ab5c72d4302c1634884230040213" target="_blank">Read more &rarr;</a>    </div><!--//media-body-->  </div><!--//media--></div><!--//item--><div class="item mb-5">  <div class="media">      <div class="media-body">      <h3 class="title mb-1"><a href="blog.html?slug=swlh%2Fhow-to-secure-kubernetes-the-easy-way-f37052139280%3Fsource%3Dfriends_link%26sk%3D869004b4fd8383333efa0eb8186206da" target="_blank">How to Secure Kubernetes the Easy Way</a></h3> <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published Apr-21</span><span class="time">9 min read</span></div>           <div class="intro"><p>How to use Terraform and Kubeadm to bootstrap your Kubernetes cluster</p><p><img class="mr-3 img-fluid d-none d-md-flex" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*Z-7kVZsMK0OE-N5_" alt="image"></p><p>Kubernetes has become a standard for running and managing container-based applications with more and more organisations moving towards and adopting it within their landscape. ...</p></div>      <a class="more-link" href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-secure-kubernetes-the-easy-way-f37052139280?source=friends_link&sk=869004b4fd8383333efa0eb8186206da" target="_blank">Read more &rarr;</a>    </div><!--//media-body-->  </div><!--//media--></div><!--//item--><div class="item mb-5">  <div class="media">      <div class="media-body">      <h3 class="title mb-1"><a href="blog.html?slug=swlh%2Fhow-we-effectively-managed-access-to-our-kubernetes-cluster-38821cf24d57%3Fsource%3Dfriends_link%26sk%3D2aef2012888303820ca8f4c7ca012022" target="_blank">How to utilise X509 Client Certificates & RBAC to secure Kubernetes</a></h3> <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published Apr-20</span><span class="time">10 min read</span></div>           <div class="intro"><p>How We Effectively Managed Access to Our Kubernetes Cluster</p><p><img class="mr-3 img-fluid d-none d-md-flex" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*zwy6fTDsKd3syo-A" alt="image"></p><p>In most organisations, adopting Kubernetes starts with developers experimenting and then running a Proof of Concept. They then spread the word, and decision-makers start getting interested and see the value. We had a similar path to our Kubernetes journey. We started with a Proof of Concept for our small five-member development team, ran a pilot with a little six-node Kubernetes cluster, and soon the management became interested in the platform and wanted to adopt it across.</p><p>Well, doing a Proof of Concept is one thing, and running Kubernetes for a sizeable multi-discipline organisation is another beast. Managing Kubernetes within the small group wasn’t tricky, and we started with sharing the admin.conf file. This file gives root access to anyone using the cluster. Therefore, this was not going to work with multiple teams working separately. We needed to do some serious thinking regarding organising, controlling access, and securing the cluster. If you don’t secure your Kubernetes cluster correctly, terrible things may happen, and it can not only hamper a company financially but also result in a loss of reputation and potential lawsuits no admin would want. ...</p></div>      <a class="more-link" href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-we-effectively-managed-access-to-our-kubernetes-cluster-38821cf24d57?source=friends_link&sk=2aef2012888303820ca8f4c7ca012022" target="_blank">Read more &rarr;</a>    </div><!--//media-body-->  </div><!--//media--></div><!--//item--><div class="item mb-5">  <div class="media">      <div class="media-body">      <h3 class="title mb-1"><a href="blog.html?slug=https%3A%2F%2Flevelup.gitconnected.com%2Fhow-to-create-a-highly-available-nginx-load-balancer-on-google-cloud-platform-9ebc8b6abb09%3Fsource%3Dfriends_link%26sk%3D6834d9206af17d039b16005a2a16dbf8" target="_blank">How to Create a Highly Available NGINX Load Balancer Google Cloud Platform</a></h3> <div class="meta mb-1"><span class="date">Published Apr-17</span><span class="time">10 min read</span></div>           <div class="intro"><p>Highly Available NGINX Load Balancer Google Cloud using Pacemaker, Corosync and Static IPs CentOS 7</p><p><img class="mr-3 img-fluid d-none d-md-flex" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*YAyaoqQvRKDVEzLq" alt="image"></p><p>With the advent of virtualised cloud-based infrastructure, more and more organisations are migrating to the cloud.
